## Highlighted Projects
**Basic Fighting Game** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Kelldav/FinalProj)]: Using Unity and various loyalty free assets created a simple fighting game. Linked Animations together, scripted the entire game, and setup sound effects.

**CAPTCHA Test Solver**: Used Machine learning technology to create a program that can solve CAPTCHA test if the questions are all handwritten numbers. Afterwards Computer vision technology was used in order to test accuracy changes. To do such various filters were applied to see if they would help the program recognize it or if it made the result more obscure.
