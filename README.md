# Brandon Angod . Jarvis Consulting

My name is Brandon Angod. I graduated from Ontario Tech University with a major in Computer Science. Throughout my time at university, I got the opportunity to learn various programming languages and implement them in multiple projects. Every year introduced new challenges to overcome and caused me to discover new methods and algorithms to solve each challenge. Currently, I work for Jarvis. Within Jarvis, I was able to get the opportunity to learn and grow in various fields. Previously within Jarvis, I was working a job as doing Software Developer. I enjoyed my time working as a Software developer role; however, it made me want to experience different roles within the field. I’ve been interested in Business System Analyst work. I’ve always been good with understanding business concepts and learned a lot throughout life about thinking of things with a business mindset, and I know the role will be a perfect fit for me.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrandonAngod](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrandonAngod)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrandonAngod/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Analyzed the requirements asked by the stakeholder and designed solutions. Examined which solution was most appropriate for the priorities and executed the solution using PostgreSQL and Bash. Created diagrams within the README to map out and explain to stakeholders the function of the project and model how the database will interact. The application will collect system data and store it within the SQL database so it can be referenced and inspected by the stakeholder to see if the cluster is functioning appropriately.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrandonAngod/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: Searches a directory for specific patterns and outputs the occurrences within a specified text file. This application functions similar to Linux's Grep command and is written in Java 8. The user types in a file path to search and an output file to write to. After the command is run the output file will contain any occurrence of the specified pattern. 
  - JDBC App: Uses the JDBC driver to connect to a PSQL database using Java to perform basic CRUD operations. 


## Highlighted Projects
**Basic Fighting Game** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Kelldav/FinalProj)]: Original Project was open ended to simply just create a game with certain requirements. So analyzing those requirements I came to the solution that I should try to make my own fighting game with basic functionality. Since the budget was low I used Unity to design it. Unity was chosen since it offers free assets allowing me to keep the budget of the project low and still get good functionality. Created a timeline to properly organize progress to arrive at the deadline within an appriate time to deliver a quality product. Within the deadline finished the project and created a final product for the stakeholder.

**CAPTCHA Test Solver**: Created a project to use Machine Learning language to analyze CAPTCHA tests and try to solve them. Analyzed the requirements of the project and the restrictions given to develop a solution. Coordinated with a peer to deliver the solution to the stakeholder. Loaded a database into the program to teach it how to identify the required information. Modeled the findings using charts to clarify the results for the stakeholder to understand clearly and in a concise matter. Wrote a formal report on the findings of the program and sent it to the stakeholder of the project.
